# 1. Description

Mechanical arm, featuring alike people’s arms, could execute a series of postures. At present, many mechanical arms are fixed style, which can’t be operated flexibly for environment and distance. On tackling this problem, KEYES group has launched a 3 in 1 learning kit-4DOF mechanical robotic arm car. With this kit, you could acquire how to control mechanical arm and smart car, what’s more, they can be combined to transform into mechanical arm smart car. I believe that you can’t help opening it to get started.
